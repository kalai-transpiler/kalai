# TODO

* data.diff
  - implement
  - port of fipp for pretty-printing
  
* Instructions (Usage, Setup)
  - [ ] Make a diagram
  - [ ] Remove Leiningen
    - [ ] add `clojure -Spom` and check that root pom.xml has no diff
  - [ ] In Readme, point to details in Contributing about minimum tools/versions
  - [ ] Add "standalone code" usage section
    - [ ] Create a versioned release so that the instructions will work
  - [X] Error handling: better error message for "wrong" file type
  - [X] Error handling: failure to properly process the Clojure code
  - [X] Command-line help message (add pointer to more info)

* Persistent data structures
  - all languages have a library, but not everyone wants the dependency
  - performance goals
  - would like to support both, choose the mutability that you want
  - need to differentiate (probably by atoms)
  - consider our own macros
  - maps/sets/vectors conj/assoc/update etc
  - import when needed
  - We might be better of using Collection builder functions instead of temporary variables?
  - We should check static block semantics
  
* Typing
  - for users
    * users need to specify a lot of typing and casting
    * would Typed Clojure be able to help?
    * explore examples (existing or new) using type aliases to abbreviate users' static typing annotation effort
    * simplify :kalias info finding (do it downstream in language pipeline rather than in kalai pipeline annotate_ast)?
    * nested aliases
  - for implementing
    * spec
    * Schema
    * Malli (?) by Metosin (?)

* Replacing Value enum with Value trait objects
  - Understand Rust output of `^{:t {:mvector [:any]}} v ^{:cast :mvector} x` in core.clj -> core.rs.  Why is kalai-type->rust being called instead of t-str in rust e-string?
    * Also investigate occurrences of Value::Null
  - Fill out all helper methods for all wrapper types that we need (Map, Vector?), not just 1 example for Set
  - updating Clojure Rust pipeline code (ex: around collections) (following the change to trait objs from enums for Value) -> this occurs in sql_builder transpiling of core.clj -> core.rs
  - Refactor {Rust,Java} identifier stringifying code in java util.clj / rust util.clj
  - We don't need "crate::kalai:...", instead only "kalai::..." - just be consistent

* In Java, nth index can only be an int, we should do that on behalf of the user and document that constraint.
* SQL builder application
  - Fix stringification of WHERE clause and fix the "op" interpolation in the WHERE clause of example f1
  - Rust sql_builder output can have a binary to run transpiled output
  - Rename kalai::Value enum to kalai::Any enum ?
  - Create "kalai::Value::MISSING_TYPE(..." output or throw an error when using `(r/value ...)` on an argument whose type is not recognized for kalai::Value instead of returning nil
  - Note: the absence of a type isn't the same as a `{:t :any}`
  - Note: the type of the inner value on the binding symbol for a nested collection didn't propagate to the binding initial value data literal's inner/nested data coll literals
  - Note: type `:any` is not specific enough to construct a collection with currently (ex: in an init aka let-binding) because the initial value can either represent a persistent vector or mutable vector, and the user must specify which one the literal represents
  - Heterogeneous collections
    * Copy over any Java tests for heterogeneous colls to Rust and make work
    * Handle ":any" type in Rust
      - Rust std::any:Any cannot work (is trait, not type/enum)
      - serde Value (enum) is interesting, but leads to follow-on enum handling
        * to cast from Value back to primitive, need to allow user to cast, and support cast with match statement
        * need to support casting as a Kalai construct in general, anyways, if we support ":any"
          - Needed for Java anyways (?) (we don't actually test in Java casting Object -> concrete type ?)
        * when getting from a collection we receive a reference type that may need to be immediately cloned
          (unless we use refs everywhere or solve it some other way)
          Note that `get` returns an Option of a reference
    * Uncertain alternative: use persistent collections to circumvent question (if they support heterogeneous?)
  - Support `(:key obj default-val)` syntax (currently: only `(get obj :key default-val)` supported)
* Type propagation: inferred types (from an initialization value) don't get propagated to call site.
  Ex:
```
(let [i (int 1)]
  (+ i i))
```
  versus
```
(let [^{:t :int} i (int 1)]
  (+ i i))
```
* Create a task in `examples` to run the output (binaries, logic tests, etc.)
  - There should be a make task should run the final compiled binary (b/c invocation is non-trivial)
  - Stretch: make should also run logic unit tests
* Verify that examples can compile using deployed artifact (namely, if/how to update deps.clj and/or pom.xml)
* Don't depend on import statements being intelligent (not hard-coded)
  - instead using fully-qualified identifier names
* Rust etc
    - swap! doesn't seem to work atm
    - how to deal with multiple overloads of fns in Rust?
    - dealing with refs?
    - do we make the user annotate the type in every assignment?
    - or do we infer this in the S-exprs?
    - how do we know when to deref a ref vs. not deref when it is not a ref (ex: Vec.insert() in demo_02.rs code)
    - or what should the question be?
    - current workaround in demo02.clj
      - annotated the types manually in the code
      - ex: `^:ref ^{:t {:mvector [:char]}} numberSystemDigits (get numberSystemsMap numberSystem)`
        (which used to be `^{:t {:mvector [:char]}} numberSystemDigits (get numberSystemsMap numberSystem)`)
  - parameterize pipeline & test helpers to be target lang-driven
  - add Java tests to Rust tests that we skipped over for temporary expediency reasons
  - things that were difficult for emitter approach in Rust
    - type modifiers
      - if a fn param is both mutable and a reference
        - fn param signature (ex1: `s: &String;` ex2: `s: &mut String`)
        - annotation of call site arg expression to the fn param (ex1: `f(&my_string)`, ex2: `f(&mut my_string)`)
        - but if `my_string` was previously defined as `let my_string: &String = &String::from("...")`, then call site would look different (ex1: `f(my_string)`, ex2: `f(mut my_string)`) to prevent passing a `&&String` type
    - general type strategy that Kalai enforces
      - primitive types to be "pass-by-value"
      - all other types to be "pass-by-reference" (all other types = heap-allocated?)
    - interop
  - make shared passes apply for all target languages
    - if so, can make them ignore leading target language symbol prefix (ex: "j/", "r/")
    - a block is just a block, why bother with r/block, j/block
  - StringBuffer mutability should be inferred
  
* Types!!!
  - Document target language type conversions (when added)
  - Validate types and narrow the set of accepted types
  - Define common types
    - supporting universals: numeric types should be signed
  - Top level def of data literal needs static block initialization `(def x [1])` for Java
  - Debug why `^Character localDigit (get numberSystemDigits remainder)` transpiles to a type declaration of `Object` but `^{:t :char} localDigit (get numberSystemDigits remainder)` gives the proper type `char` in demo02. Same for `^char sep`.
  - Troubleshoot issue in `getNumberSystemsMap` in demo02 where data literal to be return must have type annotation within a `let` binding else types are missing in Kalai compilation phase (note: also the only nested data structure in demo02)
  - Might be a nice-to-have to propagate function return type to variable identifier in variable assignments, ex: `(def x (fn-call 1 2 3))`
  - Propagate return type of fn to a data literal passed as return value in fn body implementation, ex: `(defn f ^{:t {:mmap [:char :int]}} [] {})`
  - Option types
  - (let [x (String. "abc")]) should infer :t :string
    * does this already happen 
    * also, consider turning "user-defined types" (non-Kalai supported primitives) (ex: `'java.lang.StringBuffer`) into Kalai style
    target-language type representation in target-language pipeline phase (ex: Rust syntax pass converts `'StringBuffer` into
      `{:mvector [:char]}` as early as possible)
* Test organization
  - grouping functionality
  - generate docsy from tests
    - new test directory
    - split up into more namespaces
    - don't show the Kalai intermediate syntax
    - markdown inversion
    - GitHub action
    - local action
  - Resurect placation or find some way of doing that better
* Interop
  - Add demo03 from https://github.com/echeran/kalai/pull/13 (environment variables)
  - Support import statements (ex: for user-defined classes; automatically created when user uses data collections)
  - expand the "function-call" pass (core/interop/kalai/custom)
    - depends on us choosing another target language
    - core = clojure.core fns; interop = which Java classes to support (ex: StringBuffer) out-of-the-box; kalai = other users' Kalai source; custom = 3rd-party libs/fns that users need
  - see if starter code for rust and python works
  - support array types (?) (ex: Java main method)
  - In C++ make sure that string concatenation of numbers is wrapped by std::to_string https://stackoverflow.com/questions/191757/how-to-concatenate-a-stdstring-and-an-int
  - implement `str`
* Extend demo01 and demo02
  - try using `case` instead of `cond` in `getSeparatorPositions` of demo02
  - transpile logic unit tests into target languages
* Miscellaneous
  - Filename syntax should be language specific
  - Update Design doc headings & organization
  - Throw warning/error if expression cannot be supported as statement in target language (target-language's a_syntax.clj)
  - Delete the line "import java.util.List" from Java pipeline's e-string/std-imports
* We think we have most of the proof of concept language concepts, but we need to hook up the tests
  - workflows (developer and CI)
    * documenting workflows (?)
  - salvaging existing tests
  - figure out coverage testing
  - figure out feature coverage across languages / feature parity
  - indenting strings and comparing ignoring leading space
  - elseif
  - run the output through the native language compiler
  - pleasant cider testing
* Operator and language specific transformation (e.g. = in Clojure is either .equals java or ==)
* test helper clean up
  - don't report failures twice
* Support function calls where functions are defined in input code across namespaces
  - Solve importing
* Allow users to bring their own functions
* Allow users to bring their own languages
* Indentation
* Do we support first class enums?
  - Without it you lose type strictness
  - Namespaced keywords?
  - Would require user declaration form
* Expand documentation:
  - Preserving knowledge (not tribal)
  - Keeping on track (what did we learn, why did we do that)
